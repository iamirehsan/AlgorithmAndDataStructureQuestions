Problem Description:
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Input: nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.


**

The array contains at least one element.
The subarray can contain negative numbers, but its sum must be maximized.

**

Instead of checking all possible subarrays (which is inefficient), think about keeping a running sum of the subarray.
If the running sum becomes negative, reset it to 0, as a negative sum will not contribute positively to any future subarray.
