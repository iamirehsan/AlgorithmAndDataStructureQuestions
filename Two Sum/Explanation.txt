Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

**

Each input has exactly one solution.
You may not use the same element twice.

**

Use a hash map to store numbers and their indices as you iterate.
For each number, calculate the complement (target - number) and check if it exists in the hash map.
