Problem: Merge Intervals
You are given an array of intervals where each interval is represented as [start, end]. Merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the merged intervals.

Input: [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Explanation: Intervals [1, 3] and [2, 6] overlap, so they are merged into [1, 6].


**

Intervals are given in any order.
No interval will have start > end.
The result should be returned as a sorted and merged list.

Small Hint
Sort First:

Start by sorting the intervals based on their start values.
This ensures that intervals are processed in the correct order.
Merge Logic:

Compare each interval with the previous one.
If they overlap (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the previous one), merge them.
Non-overlapping Case:

If two intervals don’t overlap, add the current interval to the result as is.
